# vue-nimble

I just wanted to emulate a product I use often called NimbleText and NimbleSet, created by Leon Bambrick.
It only copies a few basic, free features, including automatic generation on each key press.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
